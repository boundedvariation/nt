1 As many people have set themselves to compile a narrative concerning the things which were brought to fruition among us, 2 and just as those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning gave to us, 3 it seemed to me, having followed all these things from the beginning, fitting to write to you, great Theophilus, 4 so that you might recognize the certainty of what you have been taught.

5 In the days of Herod, King of the Jews, there was a priest named Zachariah, of the division of Abijah, and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 6 They were both just before God, blameless, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. 7 And they had no child, because Elizabeth was infertile, and both of them were advanced in years. 8 And he was doing his priestly routine when his division was on duty, 9 according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense, 10 and the entire multitude of people were praying outside the temple at the hour of incense. 11 And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the altar of incense. 12  Zachariah saw him and was troubled, and fear came upon him. 13 The angel said to him, "Do not fear, Zachariah, because prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will you a son, and you will name him John. 14 And he will be a delight and a joy to you, and many will be overjoyed at his birth. 15 For he will be great in the eyes of God, and he will not drink wine or liquor, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. 16 And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God, 17 and he will will go forward in the spirit and power of Elijah, and he will turn the hearts of fathers to children, and the disobedient to the righteous in wisdom, to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.

18 Zachariah said to the angel, "How will I know this? For I am old, and my wife is getting along in years." 19 The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, standing in the presence of God, and I have been sent to say these things to you and to announce to you this good news. 20 And - look - you will be silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe these things that I have said, which will be fulfilled in their proper time. 21 The people were looking for Zachariah, and they were wondering why he was taking so long in the temple. 22 When he came out he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple, and he was nodding at them, and he remained unable to speak. 23 And when the period of his service ended, he went home. 24 After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, 25 saying, "In this way the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked at me, and he has taken away my shame among the people."

26 In the seventh month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to the city of Galilee which was named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph of the house of David, and the name of the virgin was Mary. 28 And the angel went to her and said, "Rejoice, you are highly favored, the Lord is with you."
