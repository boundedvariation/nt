# MATTHEW

## 5

1 Seeing the crowds, he went up to the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. 2 Opening his mouth, he taught them, saying:

3 Blessed are the spiritual beggars, because the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
4 Blessed are the mourners, for they will be comforted.
5 Blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for justice, for they will be satisfied.
7 Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
9 Blessed are the peace-makers, for they will be called the sons of God.
10 Blessed are those who are hunted down for their righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11 Blessed are you when they reproach you and hunt you down and say all kinds of lies about you for my sake. 12 Be joyful and happy, because your reward will be great in heaven; for they hunted down the prophets in the same way before you.

13 You are the salt of the earth; if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be salty? It is has no use except to tossed away and trampled by men. 14 You are the light of the world; it is not possible to hide a city on a hill. 15 No one lights a lamp and then places it under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that it will light up the entire house. 16 Therefore let the light shine in front of everyone, so that they will see your good works and increase the fame of your father who is in heaven.

17 Do not think that I have come to abrogate the law or the prophets. I have come not to abrogate them but to fulfill them. 18 Indeed I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even a single dot or comma will pass away from the law until everything has happened. 19 Therefore whoever softens the least of these laws and teaches others to do the same will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness is greater than the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. 21 You have heard that it was said since ancient times, "do not kill; if anyone kills, they will be subject to judgment." 22 But now I am saying to you, if anyone hates their brother he will be subject to judgment. And if anyone says to his brother "f*** you", he will have to face a jury, and if anyone says "Fool!" he will face the fires of hell. 23 Therefore if you are offering a sacrifice before the altar, and there you remember that you have bad blood towards your brother, 24 leave your sacrifice at the altar, and first be reconciled to your brother, and then go and offer your sacrifice.
