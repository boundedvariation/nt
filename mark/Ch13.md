# MARK

## 13

1 As he left the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher - look! - such wonderful stones and wonderful buildings!" 2 Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? There will not be one stone standing on another that will not be destroyed.

3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives across from the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him in private, 4 "Tell us when these things will be, and what will occur when all these things are about to be accomplished?" 5 Jesus began to speak to them, "Watch out so that you are not misled. 6 Many will come in my naming, saying, 'I am he', and many will be deceived. 7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be concerned. It has to happen, but it is not yet the end. 8 For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes many places, there will be famine. These things are the beginning of the birth pains. 9 Watch out for yourself, they will give you over to the counsel and you will be beaten in the synagogues and you will be set before rulers and kings before of my as a witness to them. 10 The gospel must first be announced to every nation, 11 and whenever they give you over and bring you to trial, do not worry about what you will say, but say whatever is given to you at that moment, for you are not the one speaking, but the Holy Spirit. 12 Brother will fatally betray brother, and a father his child, and children will rise up against their parents and kill them, 13 and you will be hated by all because of my name. But he who stands his ground to the end will be saved."
