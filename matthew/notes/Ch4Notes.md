# MATTHEW

## 4

5 "perched": maybe a stretch, but I think it's justifiable.

10 "back off": a little more colloquial than I intend, but it's close to the sense, I think.

13 can't find a definition for katalipon - will need to work check on that

16 "Outsiders": I'm using for ethnoi throughout.  I might revise this later.

24 "any sort of disease" is a cop-out to avoid the list of ancient illnesses that follows. ESV does it too, so I don't feel so bad.
