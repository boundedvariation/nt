# MATTHEW

## 3

1 In those days, John the Baptist arrived, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, 2 saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand". 3 For this is the man who Isaiah the prophet spoke about when he said, 

> "The voice of one crying in the wilderness;
> prepare the way of the Lord
> make his track straight."

4 Now John wore a camel hair tunic and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. 5 Then Jerusalem and Judea and the nearby regions were coming out to see him, 6 and he baptized them in the Jordan river and they confessed their sins. 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, "What a litter of vipers! Who told you to flee the impending outburst? 8 Bear the fruit that is fit for repentence. 9 And do not think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father', for I say to you that God is not able to arouse from these rocks children of Abraham. 10 Already the axe chops at the trees; therefore he will prune out the tree that does not produce good fruit and throw it into the fire. 11 I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who is coming later is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to hold. 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will purge his threshing floor; he will bring the grain into the barn, and the chaff will burn in an unstoppable fire."

13 Then Jesus came along from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him. 14 But John stopped him, saying, "I should be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?" 14 Jesus said to him, "Allow me [to be baptized], for it is appropriate to bring about the fullness of justice." Then John agreed. 15
