# MATTHEW

## 3

1 "Arrived" isn't quite right here, but neither is "came preaching", which is awkward.

2 engiken isn't in the Perseus dictionary.  I'll need to look it up later, for now just "is at hand".

7 "What a litter of vipers" is hardly defensible, but here we are.  "Impending outburst" isn't better, but it's fun anyway.

8 "Fit for repetence": this is a genuinely weird phrase in the Greek and I'll have to think about it more.

12 "winnowing fork" - no, I don't know what this is.
