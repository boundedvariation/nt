# MATTHEW

## 19

1 When Jesus finished speaking, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea, beyond the Jordan. 2 A large crowd followed him, and he healed them there.

3 The Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying, "Is it acceptable to divorce one's wife for any reason?" 4 He answered, "Have you not read that since ancient times 'He made them male and female', 5 and he said, 'For this reason a man will leave behind his father and his mother and will cement himself to his wife, and the two of them will be one flesh?' 6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has united, let no one separate." 7 They said to him, "Why then did Moses command one to give a letter of divorce and send her away?" 8 He said to them, "Moses yielded to you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but from ancient times it was not this way. 9 I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on account of sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery." 

10 The disciples said to him, "If this is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry." 11 He said to them, "Not everyone will take this teaching into their hearts, but only those to whom it is given."
