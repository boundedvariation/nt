## 22

1 The feast of the unleavened bread, which is called Passover, drew near. 2 And the high priests and the scribes were seeking how they might kill him, for they were afraid of the people. 

3 And Satan entered Judas who was called Iscariot, who was counted as one of the twelve; 4 he went away and discussed with the high priests and the officers of the temple how he betray him to them. 5 They were glad and made a deal to give him money, 6 and he agreed, and he sought the proper time to betray him when he was separate from the crowd.

7 The day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary to sacrifice the Passover lamb. 8 And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go, prepare the passover for us so that we may eat it." 9 They said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare it?" 10 He said to them, "Look - when you go into the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house that he enters, 11 and say to the master of that house, 'The teacher says to you, "Where is a guest room where I may eat the passover meal with my disciples?"' 12 He will show you a great upper room that is furnished. Prepare it there." 13 Going out they found it was just as he had said to them, and they prepared the passover.

14 And when the hour arrived, he sat down at the table, and the apostles were with him. 15 And he said to them, "I have longed to eat this passover with you before my suffering, 16 for I say to you that I will not eat this same meal until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God." 17 Taking the cup, he gave thanks for it and said, "Take this and divide it among yourselves, 18 for I say to you, I will not drink it from now on I will not drink the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes." 19 Taking the bread he gave thanks for it, broke it, and gave it to his them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me." 20 And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. 21 But - look! - the hand of my betrayer is at the table with me. 22 For the son of man goes according to what has been appointed, but woe to that man who betrays him!" 23 They began to confer with each other about which of them was about to do this.

24 And there was rivalry among them, over which of them was regarded as the greatest. 25 He said to them, "The kings of the outsiders lord over them and those who have authority over them are called benefactors. 26 But it should not be like this with you, but let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as a servant. 27 For which of you is the greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? Not the one sits: but I among you as one who serves."
