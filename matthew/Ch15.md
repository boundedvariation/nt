# MATTHEW

## 15

1 Then the Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, "Why do your disciples violate the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread." 3 Jesus answered them, "And why do you violate the command of God for sake of your tradition? 4 For God said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'Let him who abuses his father and his mother be put to death.' 5 But you say that whoever said to his father or mother, "What you would have gained from me is given to God," 6 he does not have to honor his father; and you have set invalidated the word of God for sake of your tradition. 7 Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied truly of you,

8 This people honor me with their lips,
but their hearts are a long way from me;
9 their worship is useless,
teaching as established truth the commands of men.

10 He called the crowd and said to them, "Hear and understand: 11 it is not that which goes into the mouth that makes a person unclean, but that which comes out of the mouth." 12 Then the disciples came to him and said, "Did you know that the Pharisees heard what you said and were offended?" 13 He answered them, "Every plant that my heavenly father has not planted will be dug out by the roots. 14 Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if blind lead the blind, will not both of them fall into a trench?" 15 Peter said to him, "Explain to us this parable to us." 16 And he said, "Do you still not have a clue? 17 Do you not know that anything that goes into the mouth moves along into the bowels, and then out to the toilet? 18 But the things which come out of the mouth comes out of the heart and this defiles a person. 19 For out of the heart come evil dealings, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, perjury, and slander. 20 These are the things that defile a person, but eating with dirty hands does not defile anyone."
