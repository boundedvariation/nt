# MATTHEW

## 5

1 Seeing the crowds, he went up to the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. 2 Opening his mouth, he taught them, saying:

3 Blessed are the spiritual beggars, because the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
4 Blessed are the mourners, for they will be comforted.
5 Blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for justice, for they will be satisfied.
7 Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
9 Blessed are the peace-makers, for they will be called the sons of God.
10 Blessed are those who are hunted down for their righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11 Blessed are you when they reproach you and hunt you down and say all kinds of lies about you for my sake. 12 Be joyful and happy, because your reward will be great in heaven; for they hunted down the prophets in the same way before you.

13 You are the salt of the earth; if the salt has become bland, how can it be salty? It is of no use except to be tossed away and trampled by men. 14 You are the light of the world; it is not possible to hide a city on a hill. 15 No one lights a lamp and then places it under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that it will light up the entire house. 16 Therefore let the light shine in front of everyone, so that they will see your good works and increase the fame of your father who is in heaven.

17 Do not think that I have come to annul the law or the prophets. I have come not to annul them but to fulfill them. 18 Indeed I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even a single dot or comma will pass away from the law until everything has happened. 19 Therefore whoever softens the least of these laws and teaches others to do the same will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness is greater than the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. 

21 You have heard that it was said since ancient times, "do not kill; if anyone kills, they will be subject to judgment." 22 But now I am saying to you, if anyone hates their brother he will be subject to judgment. And if anyone says to his brother "f*** you", he will have to face a trial, and if anyone says "Fool!" he will face the fires of hell. 23 Therefore if you are offering a sacrifice before the altar, and there you remember that you have bad blood towards your brother, 24 leave your sacrifice at the altar, and first be reconciled to your brother, and then go and offer your sacrifice. 

25 Sort out your affairs quickly when an accuser takes you to court, otherwise your accuser will turn you over to the judge, and the judge will turn you over to guard, and you will be thrown into prison. 26 Truly, I say to you, you will not be free until you have returned the last penny.

27 You have heard that it was said, "do not commit adultery," 28 but now I am saying to you that anyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If your right eye trips you up, take it out and throw it away, for it is better that you lose one of your parts than for the whole body to be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand trips you up, lop it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your parts than that the whole body would go into hell.

31 It was said, "whoever divorces his wife, let him give her legal notice of the divorce."  32 But now I am saying to you that anyone who divorces his wife besides for reason of sexual misconduct causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

33 Again you have heard that it was said since ancient times, "do not swear falsely, but you shall do the thing that you have sworn to do, for the Lord's sake." 34 But now I am saying to you, do not swear at all. Neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God, 35 nor by earth, for it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king. 36 Do not swear by your head, for you are not able to make one hair white or black. 37 Let your word be yes for yes, and no for no; anything more than that comes from the evil one.

38 You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." 39 But I say to you, do not stand against evil. If anyone slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40 And to him who wants to sue you and take your shirt, give him your jacket as well. 41 If anyone forces you to a mile, go with him two miles. 42 To anyone who begs you for something, give it to him, and do not turn back on anyone who wants to borrow from you.

43 You heard that it was said, "Love your friend, and hate your enemy." 44 But now I am saying to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, 45 so that you may be sons of the father who is in heaven. For he causes the sun to shine on the wicked and the good, and sends rain to the just and the unjust. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not the tax collectors do that? 47 And if you only greet your brother, what more are you doing? Do not the Outsiders do the same? 48 Therefore be perfect, as your heavenly father is perfect.
