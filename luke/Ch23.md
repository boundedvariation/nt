1 The entire crowd got up and led him to Pilate, 2 and they began to speak against him, saying, "We found this man perverting our nation and preventing the giving of tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ, a king." 3 Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" He answered, "You have said it." 4 But Pilate said to the high priests and the crowd, "I find no fault in this man." 5 But they were impatient, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all of Judea, from Galilee even to this place."

6 When Pilate heard this, he asked whether this man was a Galilean. 7 When he learned that this was under the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him to Herod, as he was in Jerusalem in those days. 8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him, and he wished to see some sign done by him. 9 He questioned him at length, and he did not answer at all. 10 The high priests and the scribes stood by, vigorously speaking against him. 11 And Herod with his soldiers mistreated him and mocked him. Then they dressed him in bright clothing and sent him back to Pilate. 12 Herod and Pilate became friends with each other on that day, for before that they were at odds with each other.

13 Pilate called together the high priests and the leaders of the people, 14 and he said to them, "You brought this man to me as one who was diverting the people, and - look - I have examined him in front of you and found no fault in this man of the things that you have accused him of. 15 Niether did Herod, for he sent him to us, and he has done nothing deserving of death. 16 Therefore I will punish him and then let him go."

18 But they all cried out together, saying, "Take away this man, release Barabbas for us!" 19 Barabbas was a man who was thrown into prison for an uprising in the city and for murder. 20 Again Pilate addressed them, "Do you want me to release Jesus?" 21 But they called back to him, "Crucify, crucify him!" 22 A third time he said to them, "What evil has this man done? I have found no fault in him deserving death. Therefore I have punished him and I will release him." 23 But they were urgent with loud voices, begging that he be crucified, and their voices were overpowering. 24 And Pilate decided that their request should be granted. 25 He released the one who was thrown in jail for an uprising and murder, for whom they asked, and he handed over Jesus to their will.

26 As they took him away, they seized a certain Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the fields, and put the cross on him, to carry it behind Jesus. 27
