# MATTHEW

## 5

1 Seeing the crowds, he went up to the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. 2 Opening his mouth, he taught them, saying:

3 Blessed are the spiritual beggars, because the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
4 Blessed are the mourners, for they will be comforted.
5 Blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for justice, for they will be satisfied.
7 Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
9 Blessed are the peace-makers, for they will be called the sons of God.
10 Blessed are those who are hunted for their righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
