# MATTHEW

## 10

1 Calling to his disciples, he gave them power to cast out unclean spirits and to heal every sickness and weakness. 2 The names of the twelve apostles are these: first Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 3 Phillip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector, James teh son of Alphaeus and Thaddeus; 4 Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who handed Jesus over. 5 Jesus sent these twelve off, commanding them:

"Do not go to the road of the Outsiders, nor to the city of the Samaritans. 6 Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 7 When you go, preach, saying that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 8 Heal the sick, awake the dead, cleanse the lepers, throw out demons. You have taken without charge, give without charge. 9 Do not take gold or silver or copper for your wallet, no luggage for your journey, no change of clothes, no sandals or staff, for a worker has earned his food. 11
