# MATTHEW

## 1

I chose to use the X's son construction, and X and Y had Z, because I found them a little less clunky.  But then this is a clunky passage.

For spellings, I generally followed the ESV.

11b "That brings us up to the time...": definitely a divergence from the text, but it makes the sense clearer, even if it is a little chatty.

19b I'm torn on "decided", but I don't think it's that much of a stretch, and it works better than "wished" or something.

20 I dropped an idou here, and will probably do it frequently.  It doesn't really work in English to shout Behold in the middle of the sentence.

20 "Of spiritual origin"!  Yikes.  Gotta make that one better.

22 "as the prophets said it would". Will need to work more on that one.
