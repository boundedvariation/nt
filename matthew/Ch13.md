# MATTHEW

## 13

1 On that day, Jesus came out of the house and sat down by the sea. 2 And a great crowd huddled around him, so that he stepped into a boat and sat, and the entire crowd stood on the beach. 3 And he told them many things in parables, saying, "A sower of seeds went out to sow, 4 and as he sowed, some of the seeds fell along the road, and birds came and gobbled them up. 5 But other seeds fell on the rocks, where they did not have much soil; they shot up quickly, but did not have enough depth of soil, 6 and when the sun rose, they were scorched, and, since they did not have deep enough roots, they dried up. 7 Other seeds fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and strangled them. 8 But some seeds fell on good ground, and gave fruit, some a hundred times over, some sixty, and some thirty. 9 He who has ears let him hear.

10 The disciples went to him and said, "What were you talking about in that parable that you told us?" 11 He answered them, "It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them, it has not been given." 12
