# MATTHEW

## 8

1 Coming down from the hill, a great crowd followed him. 2 And immediately a leper came to him, bowing down and saying, "If you are willing, cleanse me." 3 And stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him saying, "I am willing. Be cleansed." And immediately the leper was cleansed. 4 And Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest, and bring the offering which Moses prescribed, as a testimony of the things that happened.

5 When he came to Capernaum, a centurion approached him, calling to him, 6 and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed in my home, in agony." 7 Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him." 8 Responding, the centurion said, "Lord, I am not worthy for you to come under my roof, but only speak a single word, and my servant will be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers underneath me, and I say to one of them, go, and he goes, and to another, come, and he comes, and to my servant, do this, and he does it. 10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to his followed, "Truly I say to you, I have not found faith like this in all of Israel. 11 And I say to you that many will come from east and west and recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, 12 while the sons of the kingdom are thrown out into outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth." 13 And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go on, let it be done as you have believed it would; your servant is healed this very hour." 

14 And when Jesus went into the house of Peter, he said Peter's mother-in-law lying ill with fever. 15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose, and served him. 16 When it was later in the day, many demon-possesed people were brought to him, and he threw out the spirits with a word, and he healed all who were ill. 17 Thus was the word of the prophet Isaiah fulfilled, when he said, "He took our weaknesses and held our sorrow in his hands."
