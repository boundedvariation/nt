# MATTHEW

## 6

1 Take care not to do your righteous works before men so that they can marvel at them. If you do this, you have no reward from your father in heaven. 2 When you give to the poor, do not blow a trumpet, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may pump themselves up before people. I say the truth: they have received their reward. 3 When you give to the poor, do not not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. And your father who sees in secret will reward you.

5 And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and the street corners. 6 When you pray, go into your room and close the door and pray to your father who is in secret, and your father who sees in secret will reward you. 7 And when you pray, do not blather like the Outsiders, for they expect that they will be heard because the use so many words. 8 There do not be like them, for your father knows what you need before you even ask. 

9 Therefore pray to your father in heaven like this:

Our father, who is in heaven,
Your name is sacred,
10 Let your kingdom come,
And let your will be done,
In earth as it is in heaven.
11 Give us enough bread to get through the day,
12 And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors.
13 And do not lead us into temptation,
But guard us from evil.

14 For if you forgive people's mistakes, your heavenly father will forgive you. 15 And if you do not forgive others, the father will not forgive your mistakes.

16 When you fast, do not not dismal like the hypocrites, for they distort their faces,so people will notice their fasting. 17 But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, 18 so that you will not be seen fasting by men, but by your father who is in secret. And your father who sees in secret will reward you.

19 Do not save up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and rust bring ruin, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But save up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moths nor rust bring ruin, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart is also. 

22 The lamp of the body is the eye, so if your eye is healthy, your entire body will be lit up. 23 But if your eye is wicked, your entire body will be filled with darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness! 24 No one is able to serve two masters; for he will either hate the one and love the other, or he will cling to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. 

25 Because of this I say to you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or drink, nor what clothing you will wear on your body. Is not life more than food, adn the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the sky: they do not plant crops or harvest them, or gather them into barns, but your heavenly father feeds them. Are you not more important than they are? 27 And which of you can add a single hour to his life by worrying? 28 And concerning clothes, what are you worried about? Consider the lillies of the field, how they grow up: they do not work or weave, 29 And yet, I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed as these. 30 But if God clothes the grass of the field, which is alive one day and then thrown into the oven, will he not all the more clothe you, who has so little faith?

31 Therefore, do not worry, saying, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?", for these are the things the Outsiders seek after, 32 and your heavenly father knows that you need all of them. 33 But desire first of all the kingdom of God and his justice, and all of these things will be given to you. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough evil.
