# MATTHEW

## 9

1 Getting in a boat, he crossed over, and he went into his own hometown. 2 And they brought to him a paralytic, collapsed on a bed. And Jesus saw their faith and said to the paralytic, "Be healed, child. Your sins are forgiven." 3 And some of the scribes said among themselves, "This man blasphemes!" 4 And Jesus, seeing their concerns, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts? 5 For what is easier, to say 'Your sins are forgiven' or to say 'Arise and walk'? 6 But so that you may you see that the so nof man has power on earth to forgive sins" - then he said to the paralytic, "Arise, pick up your bed, and go to your house." 7 Arising, he went to his house. 8 Seeing this, the crowd were afraid and marveled at God, who had given power to men to do such things.

9 And Jesus went on his way, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting in the customs-house, and he said to him, "Follow me."

But put new wine in new wine skins, and both will be preserved.

18 When he had said these things to them, a ruler came to them and knelt down and said, "My daughter has died, but if you go to her and lay a hand on her, she will live." Jesus and his disciples arose and followed him. 20 And a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the hem of his clothes. 21 For she said to herself, "If only I would touch his robe I will be saved." 22 Jesus turned and, seeing her, said, "Cheer up, daugher, for your faith has saved you." And the woman was healed from that moment on. 23 When Jesus came to the house of the ruler, and saw a flute-player and a crowd making noise, 24 He said,
