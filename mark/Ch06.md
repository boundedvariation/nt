# MARK

## 6

1 He left that place, and he came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. 2 When the Sabbath arrived, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many heard him and were baffled, saying, "Where did he get these things? What wisom was given to him, and how are such powerful works done by his hand? 3 Is this not the construction worker, the son of Mary and the brother of James and John and Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters with us nearby?" And they were offended by him. 4 Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not dishonored, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his household." 5 And he could not do any great works there, except for laying hands on a few people and healing them. 6 He was amazed by their unbelief. And he went around the villages teaching.

7 He called the twelve over, and he began to send them out, two by two, and gave them power over unclean spirits, 8 and he charged them not to take anything on their journey, except a staff; not bread, or a wallet, or money for their belts, 9 but to tie on sandals, and not to wear two cloaks. 10 And he said to them, "If you enter any house, remain there until you leave that place. 11 And if any place does not receive you, or hear you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet as a witness against them." 12 So they went out and preached so that the people would repent, 13 and they cast out many demons, and they anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.
