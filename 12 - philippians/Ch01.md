1 Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all of the holy ones of in Christ Jesus in Philippi with the overseers and the deacons. 2 Grace to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3 I thank my God at every memory of you, always in all of my prayers for you, 4 praying with rejoicing, 5 for your fellowship for the gospel from the first day until today, 6 being convinced of this: that he who began a good work in you will fulfill it until the day of Jesus Christ. 7 It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart, and in my chains and in my defense
