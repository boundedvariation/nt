# MATTHEW

## 5

I used hunted down throughout this passage for dioko. I can't really decide how defensible this is. 

3 I'm trying to get across ptochos as different from penos, so I use "beggar".

21 they - I'm using the Jane Austen they rather than the clunky "he or she".

22 translating raka as f*** you is my most unjustifiable decision, but what else can you do?
