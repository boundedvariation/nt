And this disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck out the grains of corn and eat them. 2 The Pharisees, seeing this, said to him, "See, your disciples do what is forbidden on the Sabbath." 3 And he said to them, "Do not what David and those who are with him did when they were hungry? 4 How they went to the house of God and ate the bread of the presence, which is was not allowed for them to eat, but only the priests alone?
